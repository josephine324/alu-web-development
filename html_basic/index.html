		<p>Always be ready to encounter challenges bacause it's the best way to learn.</P>
		<p>I am a living testimony that html is the simplest because you don't need to have prior coding knowledge.</p>
		<p>It's just you to decide whether you want to know it or not.</p>
            	<p> Html is so cool to learn because it does not need a lot of logic. It's just a matter of how much time you invest in it, and it surely pays off</p>
